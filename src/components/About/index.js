        Front-end web developer with a recently attained certificate in full 
        stack development from The University of Arizona, with newly developed skills 
        in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, mongoDB, SQL, Express.js, Node.js, Progressive Web Applications,
         and responsive web design. Known as a hard working problem solver passionate about developing 
         quality applications, with a focus on captivating, dynamic, mobile-first design and development. 
         With each project, my aim is to engage my audience for an inviting and easy experience with a product 
         that is not only visually appealing, but also trustworthy. I applied aspects of UX and agile development 
         in a recent project. I worked with a team of two other learning developers to create a single-page 
         MERN app for a local baker that acts as a functioning E-Commerce store, as well as a communication tool 
         that could be used to interact with potential customers. I am excited to leverage my skills as part of a 
         development team that builds better experiences on the web.
