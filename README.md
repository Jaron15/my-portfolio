# Portfolio
This is a portfolio for myself, Jaron Kenyon. This is a SPA (single page application) made with REACT.

## Features 
* The nav bar has four options, About me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume. When one of these options are selected the corresponding page will render.

 * The About me section contains a short paragraph about myself, the portfolio has some of my projects to be viewed, the resume has some of my Proficiencies listed, and the contact option has a form to contact me.
 
 * The portfolio section has thumbnails of some of my projects, when one is clicked on a modal will come up with a larger screenshot and buttons to close the modal, go to the deployed app, or check out the projects repository.
